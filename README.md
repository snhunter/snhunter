Usage: `python snh.py test-image.jpg`

snh.py expects input image as argument and writes result to {basename}_gamma.jpg


## Sample Images
snh.py applies gamma correction to the linear images from Supernova Hunters. Using a perceptually uniform colormap it further facilitates supernova classification.
